The figure shows two images: left and right. In order to find a pair for the pixel marked with an asterisk in the left image, you first need to compare the original images. Then, the left image is "cropped" on the left, and the right image on the right. Consider the white areas. Again we compare the pixels located at the same places in each of the images. Such offsets can be performed as many times as the size of the input photos allows. However, in order to save time, we will introduce a parameter through which you can set the maximum offset value. It will be useful to adjust it depending on the scene and the positions of the cameras relative to each other. At each step, the sums of the absolute differences for the areas into which the image is divided are calculated. We will also make the size of the area customizable. Next, we compare the amounts received. The smallest amount indicates the greatest similarity of areas.
